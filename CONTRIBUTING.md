## Pull Request Guidelines

### Creating Issues and PRs

- **Anyone can create issues** and raise PRs without needing to be assigned first Just leave a short comment mentioning that you're working on it to ensure multiple people don't work on the same Issue
- You don't need to wait for issue assignment to start working on something
- **Keep PRs as small as possible** for easier review
- If your changes are large, consider creating **sub-issues** and breaking them into multiple smaller PRs

### Code Quality

Before submitting your PR:

1. **Run Prettier** to ensure code formatting consistency:

   ```bash
   npx prettier --write .
   npx prettier --check .
   ```

2. **Wait for CodeRabbit review** after opening your PR
   - CodeRabbit is an automated code reviewer that will analyze your changes
   - **Address any feedback** that CodeRabbit provides
   - If you disagree with a suggestion, **reply with a comment** explaining why your approach makes sense

3. **Respond to all review comments** - either fix the issues or provide a thoughtful explanation
